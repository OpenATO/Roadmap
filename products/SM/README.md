# Status Manager

The Status Manager is a centralized platform for tracking compliance status and managing outstanding tasks for compliance failures. It provides a clear and intuitive user interface for managing and overseeing compliance, with clearly defined responsibility and action items for everyone involved. The platform includes a Compliance Dashboard that displays the status of monitoring agents and links to tasks that need to be completed in order to rectify any compliance failures.

## Need Statement

The Status Manager is needed to streamline the control implementation process and ensure that compliance is done in parallel to development. By providing a centralized platform for tracking compliance status and managing outstanding tasks, the Status Manager will help ensure that Devs know the requirements they need to meet from the start, and can create compliance tests before coding starts. This will result in security compliance being built into systems from the start, and government technology being more secure. Ultimately, this will enable the public to confidently access the benefits and services they need.
